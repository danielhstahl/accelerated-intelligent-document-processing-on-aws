# Development Environment Setup Guide on MacOS
# Introduction
This guide configures a comprehensive local development environment on macOS systems for the GenAI IDP accelerator.  

Purpose: Delivers an automated, scripted installation of all required development tools optimized for Apple hardware, ensuring rapid setup with minimal manual configuration. This approach leverages native macOS performance while maintaining consistency with project requirements.  

When to use this guide:  
• You're setting up development on a Mac for the first time  
• You're experiencing configuration issues with your current macOS setup  
• You prefer automated installation over manual tool configuration  
• You want to ensure exact tool versions match project specifications  

# What you'll achieve: 
A fully functional local development environment with Python 3.13, AWS CLI, Docker Desktop, VS Code with AI extensions, and integrated development tools - all configured through a single automated setup script. This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a development environment on macOS. It covers installing essential tools such as VS Code, Python 3.13.x, AWS CLI, SAM CLI, Node.js, Docker Desktop, Miniconda, Cline for VS Code, and Amazon Q in Terminal.

# Prerequisites

-   macOS 12+ (Monterey) recommended; Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel
    are both supported.

-   An admin account on the Mac (you may be prompted for your password).

-   Stable internet connection.

### **Clone the Repository**

To get the sample project locally, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws.git
```

Change your directory to access the mac_setup.sh file

# Quickstart (One-Command Script)

If you prefer to automate everything, download the script and run:
```bash 
chmod +x mac_setup.sh
./mac_setup.sh
```


# Step-by-Step Instructions

## 1) Install Xcode Command Line Tools (and Rosetta, if needed)

Xcode Command Line Tools provide compilers and essential build tools.
Rosetta is required for some Intel-only tools on Apple Silicon.

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install 2>/dev/null || echo "Xcode CLT already installed or prompt will appear."

# (Apple Silicon only) Install Rosetta if not installed
if [[ "$(uname -m)" == "arm64" ]]; then
    if ! /usr/bin/pgrep oahd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license || true
    fi
fi
```


## 2) Install Homebrew

Homebrew is the package manager we will use to install most dependencies.

```bash
# Install Homebrew (skips if already installed)
if ! command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
fi

# Add brew to PATH for current shell session
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv 2>/dev/null || /usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
```


## 3) Install Visual Studio Code

You can install VS Code via Homebrew (recommended) or manually from
Microsoft.

```bash
\# Install VS Code via Homebrew Cask\
brew install \--cask visual-studio-code
```


## 4) Python (pyenv + optional Miniconda)

We'll install pyenv to manage Python versions and optionally Miniconda for data workflows. This replaces the Linux-specific alternatives/yum/dnf steps in your original script.

```bash
# Install pyenv and dependencies
brew update
brew install pyenv

# Initialize pyenv for zsh
if ! grep -q 'pyenv init' ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null; then
    echo '
# pyenv setup' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
fi

# Use pyenv to install and set Python 3.12 (adjust if you prefer 3.11, etc.)
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
pyenv install -s 3.12.5
pyenv global 3.12.5

# Upgrade pip and install virtualenv
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install virtualenv

# (Optional) Miniconda via Homebrew
# brew install --cask miniconda
```

## 5) AWS CLI v2

On macOS, the simplest way is via Homebrew.

```bash
brew install awscli

# Test
aws --version
```


## 6) AWS SAM CLI

Install SAM CLI from AWS Homebrew tap.

```bash
brew tap aws/tap
brew install aws-sam-cli

# Test
sam --version
```


## 7) Node.js via nvm (Node 18 LTS)

Use nvm to manage Node versions. This mirrors your Linux section but uses zsh-friendly profile updates.

```bash
# Install nvm
if [ ! -d "$HOME/.nvm" ]; then
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
fi

# Load nvm for current shell
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# Install Node 18 LTS
nvm install 18
nvm alias default 18

# Test
node -v
npm -v
```



## 8) Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is the recommended way to run containers on macOS. It includes a lightweight VM and provides Docker Engine & Compose.

```bash
brew install --cask docker

# After installation, launch Docker.app from /Applications or via Spotlight.
# Give it a minute to start the backend; then test:
# docker version
```


## 9) Open Interpreter (optional)

Install with pip. You can later configure any model/provider you want (kept generic here).

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade open-interpreter

# Run with: interpreter
```



## 10) Shell Quality-of-Life Settings (zsh)

On macOS, zsh is the default shell. We'll add a small include folder to keep the main ~/.zshrc tidy.

```bash
# Create include directory for .zshrc snippets
mkdir -p ~/.zshrc.d

# Add an include line to ~/.zshrc if not already present
if ! grep -q 'for f in ~/.zshrc.d/*.zsh' ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null; then
    cat <<'EOF' >> ~/.zshrc

# Load custom zsh snippets
if [ -d "$HOME/.zshrc.d" ]; then
    for f in $HOME/.zshrc.d/*.zsh; do
        [ -r "$f" ] && source "$f"
    done
fi
EOF
fi

# Create a generic preferences snippet
cat <<'EOF' > ~/.zshrc.d/00-preferences.zsh
# History settings
setopt APPEND_HISTORY
HISTSIZE=100000
SAVEHIST=100000

# Prompt (simple)
PROMPT='%F{green}%n@%m%f:%F{blue}%~%f$(git_prompt_info) $ '

# Aliases
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3

# (Optional) nvm autoload
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
EOF
```

## 11) Verify Your Setup

- VS Code: Open it from Applications. Install extensions as needed (e.g., Python, Docker, AWS Toolkit).
- Python: run `python --version` and `pip3 --version`.
- Node: run `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- AWS CLI: run `aws --version`.
- SAM CLI: run `sam --version`.
- Docker: launch Docker.app, then run `docker version` in Terminal.

## **12) Install Python Dependencies for publish.py**

Install the required Python packages for the publish.py script:

```bash
pip install boto3 rich PyYAML botocore setuptools docker
```

> **Note**: The `docker` Python package is required for container-based Lambda deployments.

## **13) Configure AWS CLI**
### Refer this link for AWS configure
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html  

## **14) Run Publish Script**

### Using publish.py (Recommended)

Test publish script help:
```bash
python3 publish.py --help
```

Test standard ZIP-based deployment:
```bash
python3 publish.py bucket_name build-test us-east-1
```

Pattern-2 container images are built and pushed automatically when Pattern-2 changes are detected. Ensure Docker is running and you have ECR permissions.

**Troubleshooting Build Issues:**
If the build fails, use the `--verbose` flag to see detailed error messages:
```bash
python3 publish.py bucket_name build-test us-east-1 --verbose
```

The verbose flag will show:
- Exact SAM build commands being executed
- Complete error output from failed builds
- Python version compatibility issues
- Missing dependencies or configuration problems

### Using publish.sh (Legacy)

Test publish script help:
```bash
./publish.sh --help
```

Test build using publish.sh:
```bash
./publish.sh bucket_name build-test us-east-1
```

- If `brew` is not found, add it to PATH: 
```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv 2>/dev/null || /usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

- If `pyenv` shims don't work, ensure its init lines are in `~/.zshrc` and open a new Terminal.

- On Apple Silicon, some images/tools may need Rosetta. Install it with `softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`.

- Docker needs to be running before `docker` commands succeed. Launch Docker.app and wait for the whale icon to be steady.
