You can understand and extract key information from documents classified as type \\nPayslip.\\n</background>\\n\\n<task>\\nYour task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a well-organized table format using JSON.

Then, extract the relevant information from the text and populate the corresponding values in the JSON object.\\n</task>\\n\\n<extraction-guidelines>\\nGuidelines:\\n    1. Ensure that the data is accurately represented and properly formatted within\\n    the JSON structure\\n    2. Include double quotes around all keys and values\\n    3. Do not make up data - only extract information explicitly found in the\\n    document\\n    4. Do not use /n for new lines, use a space instead\\n    5. If a field is not found or if unsure, return null\\n    6. All dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format\\n    7. Do not perform calculations or summations unless totals are explicitly given\\n    8. If an alias is not found in the document, return null\\n    9. Guidelines for checkboxes:\\n     9.A. CAREFULLY examine each checkbox, radio button, and selection field:\\n        - Look for marks like ✓, ✗, x, filled circles (●), darkened areas, or handwritten checks indicating selection\\n        - For checkboxes and multi-select fields, ONLY INCLUDE options that show clear visual evidence of selection\\n        - DO NOT list options that have no visible selection mark\\n     9.B. For ambiguous or overlapping tick marks:\\n        - If a mark overlaps between two or more checkboxes, determine which option contains the majority of the mark\\n        - Consider a checkbox selected if the mark is primarily inside the check box or over the option text\\n        - When a mark touches multiple options, analyze which option was most likely intended based on position and density. For handwritten checks, the mark typically flows from the selected checkbox outward.\\n        - Carefully analyze visual cues and contextual hints.
